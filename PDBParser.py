"""
Read all lines containing HELIX or SHEET, and then extract residue sequence number data from each line
to determine associated atoms which comprise the secondary structures. Print to an output PDB file only
those lines containing HELIX or SHEET, and the atoms which share a residue sequence number within one of
the specified ranges.

As each line is read in and stored as a string variable, this means that you should begin indexing (counting columns) from 0.
HELIX residue sequence numbers can be found in columns 21-24 (initial) - entry 6 on line, and columns 33-36 (terminal), entry 9 on line.
SHEET residue sequence numbers can be found in columns 22-25 (initial) - entry 7 on line, and columns 33-36 (terminal), entry 10 on line.
ATOM singular residue sequence number can be found in columns 22-25 - entry 6 on line.
